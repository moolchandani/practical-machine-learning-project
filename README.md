Practical Machine Learning Project

This is the course project for Coursera's Practical Machine Learning, as part of the specialization in Data Science. It was built up in RStudio, using its knitr functions, meant to be published in html format.
This  analysis meant to be the basis for the course quiz and a prediction  assignment writeup. The main goal of the project is to predict the  manner in which 6 participants performed some exercise as described  below. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. The machine  learning algorithm described here is applied to the 20 test cases  available in the test data and the predictions are submitted in  appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated  grading.  

Files: 
Practical Machine Learning Project Report.Rmd is the r-markdown for the write-up.
Practical-Machine-Learning-Project-Report.md is the markdown file.
Practical-Machine-Learning-Project-Report.html is the compiled HTML file.
